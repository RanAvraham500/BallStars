# Ball Stars
This android app is a game I developed in android studio. The main theme of the game is that your character - a ball, moves according to your phone's sensors.
Firstly you have to sign in to your user or create a new one if you don't have any. Afterwards you can customize your character by choosing/buying a skin. 
After you finishes customizing your character you can start the game. There are two game modes to chose from: Coins or Maze, each has it's own rules. 
In the gamemode Coins your goal is to collect as many coins in one minute, in addition to the coins generated on the screen there are also bomb and clock objects. Collecting a bomb will take 5 seconds from your time and collecting a clock object will add 10 seconds to your timer. 
In the gamemode Maze your goal is to complete as much of the maze as possible, the maze is generated randomly on the screen and you have to navigate your character through it. If you have hit the maze it self you have lost the game. 
In addition to the game logic there are also game effects such as: music or vibration, that you can expirience while playing the game.
When you finished playing the game you can see your score, and when you return to the home screen you can see the leaderboards of the two gamemodes.
For building this app I used Firebase for my backend.
